# C++ Registry Pattern

An implementation of the Registry pattern, which allows derived classes of a common super class to be constructed by their string class name. All subclasses must share a common constructor in order to be constructed by this implementation of the registry pattern.

See registry.h and examples/example.cpp for detailed usage information and important linking information.
